# First project/repo: A basic semantic HTML boilerplate

This is officially my first repo and project entry on Github (yay!). My intention is to start from the basics of creating human- and machine-readable HTML with semantic elements.

Also, a README is a text file that introduces and explains a project. It contains information that is commonly required to understand what the project is about.

# Mission

Create a simple HTML page which could e.g. be used as a boilerplate for a small web or portfolio site.
